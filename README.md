ISS-IBX
=======

Waterloo ISS tools to talk to an Infoblox appliance.

IBDump.pl gets all the extensible attributes for a given host and has options to dump just particular ones.

IB-AllEAs.pl prints just a few extensible attributes in a different format. It's probably mis-named, at least for its present function.
